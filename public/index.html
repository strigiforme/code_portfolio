              <strong class = "accent"> Student: </strong> I'm a fourth year student at <a href = "https://www.dal.ca/" target="_blank">Dalhousie University</a> studying Computer Science <em class="small-text"> (Semester 7/8) </em>.
              I plan to graduate in spring 2021 with a Bachelor's degree of Computer Science, certificate in artificial intelligence, and designation for their co-operative education program.
              I finish my last semester in the fall of 2020 and am ready to work immediately after this.
              Professionally I am interested in back-end development and working with machine learning algorithms.
              I am also interested in full-stack development, but am not interested in doing exclusively front end work.

              <strong class = "accent"> Athlete: </strong> I have played sports since I was 6, mostly playing hockey but I also have played soccer, baseball, and football.
              I also started training at the gym in 2018, and have been going regularly since. I primarily do strength training, but also run outdoors while weather permits.
              For me fitness is a great way to clear my head and refresh myself after spending long periods of time at the keyboard or indoors.
              I find it very rewarding to set long-term fitness goals for myself and achieve them. I also enjoy competing with my friends who I train with.

              <strong class = "accent"> Creator: </strong> My passion for Computer Science stems from my passion for creating in general.
              It's my lifelong passion to create new things in varying and engaging ways.
              I am a hobbyist woodworker, graphic designer, sewist, and I enjoy electronics using microcontrollers such as Arduino.
              To me, making something from nothing and overcoming the challenges that come along the way to be the most rewarding thing you can do.
              I also enjoy repairing things that I buy, and doing the same for my friends.
