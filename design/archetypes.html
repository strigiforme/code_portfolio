          <h2 class = "small-header"> Archetypes </h2>
          <p class = "small indent">
            The use of archetypes enables the construction of an identity that
            is easily recognizable, and has innate characteristics that are
            universal to all. Archetypes have been employed with success at
            companies, in literature, and in self discovery. By applying
            archetypes to a brand or design, you gain consistency, personality,
            and you may better understand your strengths and shortcomings.
          </p>
          <h2 class = "small-header"> My Archetypes </h2>
          <p class = "small indent">
            My personality most strongly features three archetypes:
            <em>The Creator</em>, <em>The Hero</em>, and <em>The Sage</em>.
            While a person is a blend of many Archetypes, a brand should only
            consist of 1-2 archetypes in order to be more recognizeable. As such,
            I will be using <a href="https://astute.co/the-creator-archetype/" target="_blank">The Creator</a>
            and <a href="https://astute.co/brand-archetypes-the-hero/" target="_blank">The Hero</a>
            archetypes for my brand. I have chosen these archetypes because they
            describe me the best, and also are the attributes I value most. I will
            discuss both these archetypes and how they will inform my brand.

            <h3 class = "sub-header" > 1. The Creator </h3>
            <p class = "small">
              Ever since I was young, I have felt the desire and want to create
              unique things of my own design. Creating is a central part of my
              identity and life goals. The Creator archetype has helped me reify
              this desire and how I can find more fulfillment from it. My goal
              as a creator is to become masterful at creating in many ways.
              This desire for mastery also is a facet of the hero archetype.
            </p>
            <p class = "small">
              My primary objective as a creator is to be able to do as I please
              unimpeded by restriction. The only restrictions I find
              arise in the nature of the work, and I find great pleasure in
              overcoming these challenges.

              <li> + Aesthetic/Assiduous Design </li>

                I intend to incorporate the Creator archetype in my design via the following:
              </p>
              <p class = "small indent">
                <strong>Thoughtful Design:</strong> All elements that are associated
                with my brand should have their design carefully planned and
                look intentional. This speaks to devotion and skill as a creator.
              </p>
              <p class = "small indent">
                <strong>Playful Design:</strong> An element of expressiveness
                and playfulness should be present in the design. This helps combat
                perceived aggression in design, and conveys expressivity and
                freedom to be imaginative.

            <h3 class = "sub-header" > 2. The Hero </h3>
            <p class = "small">
              The Hero archetype embodies heroes from stories, athletes, leaders,
              and masters of fields. They overcome challenge and adversity in
              order to better themselves. Heroes are bold, powerful, and striking.
              For me, The Hero archetype is strongly associated with my goals
              as The Creator, where my desire is to overcome challenge and
              demonstrate mastery as a Creator is my primary purpose.
            </p>
            <p class = "small">
              Heroes are also known for their self-sacrifice and loyalty to others.
              These attributes are intrinsic to my beliefs, but I struggle with
              determining how much self sacrifice is too much, where I may stretch
              myself too thin.

            <ul style = "list-style: none; color: black;">
              <li> + Brave, bold brand design </li>

                <strong>Bold Design:</strong> The Hero archetype should be
