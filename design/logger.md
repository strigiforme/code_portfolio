# Introduction
SWDD for logger module

## Purpose
This SWDD details the implementation of the logger module within the context of the web portfolio. Architectural and design decisions are discussed as well.

## Scope
The logger is a singleton module that handles console output and logging from the web portfolio. It allows for fine-grained control of logging, and configuration of log level. This allows for fine-grained debugging without having to add new logs to the portfolio.

## Overview
This document discusses the design of the logger, and justifications for design choices. The implementation in the context of the software portfolio is discussed as well, along with implementation details that help guide the implementation of the software.
