          strong.accent  Student:
          |  I&apos;m a fourth year student at
          a(href='https://www.dal.ca/' target='_blank') Dalhousie University
          |  studying Computer Science
          em.small-text  (Semester 7/8)
          | .
          |               I plan to graduate in spring 2021 with a Bachelor&apos;s degree of Computer Science, certificate in artificial intelligence, and designation for their co-operative education program.
          |               I finish my last semester in the fall of 2020 and am ready to work immediately after this.
          |               Professionally I am interested in back-end development and working with machine learning algorithms.
          |               I am also interested in full-stack development, but am not interested in doing exclusively front end work.

          strong.accent  Athlete:
          |  I have played sports since I was 6, mostly playing hockey but I also have played soccer, baseball, and football.
          |               I also started training at the gym in 2018, and have been going regularly since. I primarily do strength training, but also run outdoors while weather permits.
          |               For me fitness is a great way to clear my head and refresh myself after spending long periods of time at the keyboard or indoors.
          |               I find it very rewarding to set long-term fitness goals for myself and achieve them. I also enjoy competing with my friends who I train with.

          |               I am a hobbyist woodworker, graphic designer, sewist, and I enjoy electronics using microcontrollers such as Arduino.
          |               To me, making something from nothing and overcoming the challenges that come along the way to be the most rewarding thing you can do.
          |               I also enjoy repairing things that I buy, and doing the same for my friends.
