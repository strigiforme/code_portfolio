My Web Portfolio
================

This project is a website that allows me to showcase work that I have done via 
my hobbies. It is intended to demonstrate my skill as a software developer, by 
projects I have posted on it, and also the fact that I have built this project 
on my own from scratch.

History
=======

I started this project as a project for one of my university classes, Web Centric
Computing. I only had very basic features implemented by the end of the project.
The features I had implemented as well were not robust, and created while I was
still learning how to use Node.JS and Express to host a website. Since then I 
have spent a considerable amount of time refactoring that code to allow for
further expansion without having the project collapse on itself. I work on this
in my fleeting spare time.

Intent
======

The portfolio is a software that creates a framework for managing user generated
content. This content should be produced by a single administrator (the owner)
that is visible to users. To make your own portfolio based on this software, you
will need to provide your own views (HTML pages) for the software to render.
This project is currently filled with my own content, since I don't want to put
too much effort into having other people being able to use it.

Learning
========

Undertaking this project has taught me quite a bit. I have attempted to make my
own personal website 5 times now. Scrapping each previous iteration has taught
me a lot of software development, project design, and how to manage work
sustainable so that I don't get burnt out and drop the project entirely. Some
of the topics that I have learned include the following subjects:

**Networking:** I have learned much about how DNS servers work and how to 
redirect a request to a domain name to my personal computer. Subjects like
Resource Records, SSL Certificates, HTTP and HTTPS protocols are some of the
topics that I understand in detail through this project.

**Node.JS:** I started this project with no experience Node.JS and the Express
framework. I have gained a much better understanding of development using Node,
as well as familiarity with the rest of this portfolio's tech stack.

**Design:** Graphic Design and web design have always been a great source of 
pain for me. I have no formal education in either, but I want to create a 
product with a professional look and feel. The Design principles I have learned
have been valuable, and through external design consultations and education 
using online resources, I hope to learn a great deal more.

**CI/CD:** While still simple, I have implemented my own CI suite for this
gitlab project through the use of Jenkins CI. I hope to learn more about CI and
CD as this project grows in scale and complexity.

**Project Management:** Using the project management tools offered by Gitlab has
been insightful. My experience with the Agile Methodology at work has also given
me some insight into this project. I am not practicing Agile in this project
since I am the only contributor, but I am managing my work using issues, and
the use of tags + milestones has given me valuable insight into how I can divide
project work into easily workable sections.

Features (planned or already existing)
======================================

The software will have or already has the following abilities:

- Documentation of several types of project [software, woodworking, excercise, etc.]
- Tutorials on different procedures
- Blog posts on varying topics
- Executable code snippets for viewers to try (safely)
- Safe administration features that are resistant to external attacks

Future plans
============

**Dedicated Hardware:** I am currently hosting this on my gaming PC, but would
like to tranisition to using raspberry pi hardware to host. This offers more 
security since I can host the website inside of a DMZ. This also allows me to 
set up my own deployment suite to gain valuable experience.

**Graphic Design Practice:** This project allows me to experiment with graphic
design as well as user experience design. I intent to have an external designer
or design agency provide me with a style guide that I can implement to learn
more about website design, as well as have a sharp looking website to represent
me.
